                    <h3>Australian Elections</h3>
                        <p> To understand the model, you must understand how Australian elections work.
                            In Australia, we have a compulsory preferential voting system. This means that
                            almost all enrolled vote, which removes the complication of turnout, but adds the massive
                            complexity of
                            predicting preference flows.</p>

                        <h3>All 151 Seats</h3>
                            <p>On election day there are 151 separate elections, one for each seat in the house of
                                representatives. This model works by first predicting national and state primary votes
                                using
                                polls, and then performs a regression analysis to calculate what's called
                                Two-Party-Preferred Swings.
                                Two-Party-Preferred are the votes after preferences of the top two candidates,
                                usually Labor and the Coalition.</p>

                            <p>Then the model simulates results in each of the 151 seats and tallies up the results.
                                If either the Coalition or Labor reach 76 seats then they win the election. If neither
                                of them do,
                                then we enter hung parliament territory.</p>
                            <h3> Rinse and repeat</h3>
                                <p>We repeat our simulation many times to calculate the probability of
                                    victory in the election. As we get closer to the election,
                                    the model will get more confident.</p>

                    <h2>Open Source</h2>
                    <p>I'm a believer in the idea of open source data. That means
                        I don't hide my code or the data I used to make predictions.
                        If you want to take a look, use the code for yourself and attempt to improve it,

                    <h3>Not all polls are created equal.</h3>
                    <p>Many things effect the quality of a poll and how representative
                        it is of the actual electorate. When a new poll is released data is entered
                        into the model. The model does two things. 
                    
                    <p>   First it adds the primary vote and predicted TPP, if there are any 
                        to the regression model. The regression model weights 2019 election preference flows and 2022 predicted
                        preference flows equally, allowing us to average out the predicted preference flows, and account for some reversion to the mean.
                        The process is theoretically more accurate than any individual pollsters prefrence calculations, and allows us to use data from polls
                        that don't report a TPP result.
                    </p> 
                    <p>    
                        The model then takes the primary data and runs it through the regression model to create
                        a predicted TPP result. This is done for all the polls, which are then weighted by date published and sample size.
                    </p>

                </div>

                <div class="col">
                    <h3>Correlation Model</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Each seat isn't in it's own bubble.</strong>
                        Seats across the country correlate with one another. For example,
                        if the Hunter swings one way, Eden-Monaro is more likely to swing in the same direction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The model uses this fact to create a correlation matrix. That quanitifies the effect that each seat tends to have on 
                        the other. This means that when we simulate an election, we can simulate
                        likely seats across the country.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The way the model does this is by ordering all the seats randomly. Then it simulates the first seat.
                        The result in the first seat updates all the rest of the seats. Then the second seat is simulated, and that result
                        updates the rest. So forth and so on. This creates more accurate swings across the country,
                        but it makes the need to do many simulations much more important.
