                    <h3>Not all polls are created equal.</h3>
                    <p>Many things effect the quality of a poll and how representative
                        it is of the actual electorate. When a new poll is released data is entered
                        into the model. The model does two things. 
                    
                    <p>   First it adds the primary vote and predicted TPP, if there are any 
                        to the regression model. The regression model weights 2019 election preference flows and 2022 predicted
                        preference flows equally, allowing us to average out the predicted preference flows, and account for some reversion to the mean.
                        The process is theoretically more accurate than any individual pollsters prefrence calculations, and allows us to use data from polls
                        that don't report a TPP result.
                    </p> 
                    <p>    
                        The model then takes the primary data and runs it through the regression model to create
                        a predicted TPP result. This is done for all the polls, which are then weighted by date published and sample size.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Correlation Model</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Each seat isn't in it's own bubble.</strong>
                        Seats across the country correlate with one another. For example,
                        if the Hunter swings one way, Eden-Monaro is more likely to swing in the same direction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The model uses this fact to create a correlation matrix. That quanitifies the effect that each seat tends to have on 
                        the other. This means that when we simulate an election, we can simulate
                        likely seats across the country.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The way the model does this is by ordering all the seats randomly. Then it simulates the first seat.
                        The result in the first seat updates all the rest of the seats. Then the second seat is simulated, and that result
                        updates the rest. So forth and so on. This creates more accurate swings across the country,
                        but it makes the need to do many simulations much more important.
