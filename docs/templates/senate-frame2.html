                    This model only attempts to find the most likely outcome for the senate result. Making an accurate prediction is hard!
                    For example, the model is currently predicting that the liberals win three senate seats in NSW, but only two in QLD. That could happen
                    but that seems distinctly unlikely. So take these values as qualitative rather than predictive.

                    <strong>The Australian senate is unfair.</strong> The ACT only has two senators, neither of which are up for election this year. Meanwhile, Tasmania has twelve senators and six are up for re-election. 
                    This is despite the fact that they have similar populations (430,000 vs 540,000). The six times over-represenation isn't the worst of it. Because ACT and NT senators are elected at the same time,
                    it is almost guaranteed that Labor will receive one senator and the Coalition the other. This denies the territories democratic choice, making the senate an unrepresentative body.
